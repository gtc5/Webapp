We serve a range of populations with multiple barriers to access, including immigrant women, sole-support parents, street-involved youth, and OW/ODSP recipients. For some participants, the burden would be particularly heavy without the Second Harvest donations and women are often the first to sacrifice their comfort (including food) for their families' due both to cultural expectations as well as self-imposed pressure.  Recently, a participant disclosed that she is reluctant to visit food banks due not simply to the stigma, but to negative experiences with other service users and the anxiety that it caused. In the absence of Second Harvest, she would either have to access the food bank or more likely, she would have less food to eat.  If participants came to English classes or skills development training hungry or even ""simply"" worried about their next meal, they would likely find it difficult to focus in class and retain the information they need to overcome language barriers. Absenteeism would likely increase as well due to the fatigue, illness, and anxiety that hunger and stress can create. As a result, participants' performance would suffer as well as their relationships with their peers and the agency as a whole.   Furthermore, participants would lose organic opportunities to discuss food (in)security, hunger, and the cost of living with people in different programs and they might hesitate to approach settlement staff to enquire about food banks, despite our best efforts to raise awareness about these services.","Yes, permission to share information in Second Harvest promotional materials.",,An interview with Second Harvest.,,,,,,530,,Supplementary Food Program (i.e. tenant food program),,Drop-in Community Snack/Meal Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,Mon,,,,,,,,Mon,Tues,Wed,Thurs,,,,N/A,,,,,,Sat,,,,,,,,,,N/A,,,,,,,,N/A,,,,,,,,N/A,,,,,,,,N/A,,,,,,,,N/A,"Yes, our organization is open on weekends.",,,Our organization is <u>not</u> open 24 hours.,5,English Language Program (ELP) - Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada,Newcomer Women's Network - Drop In Saturday Program,,,,,,SEW IT - Fashion Entrepreneurship Program,Cook It! - Self-Care & Stress Management,Employment Ontario / Youth Job Connection,,,,,,259,35,,,,,,65,70,101,,,,,,100,10,,,,,,15,25,0,,,,,,18,0,,,,,,11,0,100,,,,,,130,15,,,,,,38,45,1,,,,,,11,10,,,,,,1,0,0,,,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,0,,,,,0,,,,,0,28%,24%,10%,35%,3%,Children,Youth,Seniors,Single persons,Single-parent families,Two-parent families,Couples with no children,Multi-family households,,,Working poor,Individuals with substance abuse issues,Individuals with mental illness,Individuals with physical illness,,Individuals with physical disabilities,Street-involved,"Homeless or under-housed (living in a shelter, group home, on the street and /or temporarily with family or friends)",Survivors of abuse,,,Newcomers to Canada (within the last 10 years),China,India,Pakistan,,Christian,,Hindu,Muslim,,No religious affiliation,Unknown,70%,Almost all of the time,Yes,"This year, Newcomer Women's Services Toronto (NEW) introduced Cook It! - Stress Management & Self Care for Single Mothers and Employment Ontario's Youth Job Connection.

Given that clients had limited financial resources, they often had limited access to fresh, nutritious food and cooking itself became a fraught process as they tried to meet their own and their children's needs in a busy household. The program aimed not only to bring women together through food, but to bring the joy back to cooking and provide participants with enough food to take home. While the program included a budget for food, Second Harvest helped to supplement the menu and gave women a little more to take home with them if they wanted to recycle the recipe.  Employment Ontario's Youth Job Connection (YJC) provides pre-employment training and job placement to unemployed or under-employed youth with multiple barriers to labour market access. YJC clientele include racialized, homeless or street-involved, and immigrant youth; youth with mental health concerns, addiction issues, and/or disabilities; and others. Youth Outreach Workers provide youth with snacks during training to help them maintain their focus and recognizing that many youth have limited financial means, staff routinely send participants home with nutritious food items to help them.
